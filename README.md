# Amrita-Score-Scanner
This Android app scans a score sheet using the phones camera and using DL4J deeplearning library predicts the digits in the score sheet. User has possiblity to correct score.

Seems to not work so well on 'long' phones. Works fine on phones like Yuphoria YU, Samsung Galaxy S5.
